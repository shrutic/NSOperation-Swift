 # GCD basics
 
To ensure that developers focus more on business logic than the intricacies of threads(priorities, memory usage), Apple introduced GCD in iOS 4 ( along with on OSX). GCD, an ObjC API, manages a thread pool that all of its callers can reuse.
 
 # Technical information
 
 GCD provides ability to create queues ( aka dispatch_queues) where developers can schedule blocks of logic synchronously or async wrt caller
 
GCD provides 5 queues by default ( one queue that runs on main thread and 4 other queues with different priorities of execution)

 Any custom queues created by developer, will eventually be executed in one of these 4 default queues. It is not recommended to create a custom queue for running on main thread
 
 The priorities of the 4 defaults queues ( Queue running on main thread always has the highest priority)
 * Background
 * Low
 * Default
 * High

 ## Playground example description
 
 This playground example runs on one of the 5 dispatch_queues provided by the GCD ( with .Default priority).

    sleep(5) // Representative of long running task
    
    print("Task completed")
    
    PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
}

// Dispatch_async schedules operation and returns immediately even if the operation execution isnt complete
print("Task may or may not have completed")

  ### Additional GCD facts:
 
  * Provides the ability to group multiple tasks and wait on them
  
  * Provide dispatch semaphores to regulate use of finite resources
 
  * Dispatch_queues are thread safe
